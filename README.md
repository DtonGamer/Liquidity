MaaS stands for "Meme as a Service"—but it's broader than just memes. It's a creative-analytical framework you're developing where you take any piece of content (an image, a situation, a conversation, anything) and describe it through the lens of a specialized conceptual vocabulary or "method." Think of it like this: imagine you're holding a prism up to reality. Depending on which angle you hold it, you see different colors—different aspects of the same light. MaaS is about deliberately choosing different prisms (computer science, biology, physics, game theory, etc.) and seeing what gets revealed when you translate everyday experiences through those specialized languages... let's look at this tweet, pic the appropriate lense and let see what gets revealed: Most people think price in crypto is the result of organic buying and selling.

It isn’t.

Price is a negotiation between liquidity and intent - and in crypto, liquidity is thin, fragmented across countless CEXs/DEXs, and remarkably easy to influence.

A market maker isn’t a shadowy villain with a big red button. In theory, their job is simple: provide bids and asks so trading can happen smoothly. In practice, where that liquidity is placed, how dense it is, and when it’s added or removed matters more than almost anything else.

In traditional markets, liquidity is deep, regulated, and spread across massive venues. In crypto, liquidity often lives in a few pools with large gaps in between. When they want price to move, it doesn’t glide - it jumps. It falls through empty space or accelerates upward once resistance disappears.

This is how price can be pushed down without massive selling. Pull liquidity below price and even moderate sell pressure can cause a cascade. The chart looks like panic, but structurally it’s just gravity doing its thing.

The same mechanics work in reverse.

Stack liquidity strategically, absorb sells, and allow buyers to hit thin air above. Once overhead liquidity is removed or exhausted, price doesn’t need explosive demand to rise - it simply travels to the next available pocket. That’s how you get slow, controlled climbs that suddenly turn into vertical moves with no obvious catalyst.

Derivatives amplify all of this. Perpetuals introduce leverage, leverage creates liquidation levels, and liquidation levels become magnets. When too many traders lean the same way, price doesn’t move because the market is “wrong.” It moves because clearing those positions is profitable and mechanically easy to the powers that be.

This is why you see clean stops run below support and euphoric breakouts above resistance that immediately accelerate. The market isn’t reacting - it’s being guided through liquidity.

To newcomers, this feels fake.

Compared to traditional equities, it kind of is.

But that doesn’t make it evil or unwinnable. It just means you stop asking why price moved and start asking who benefited from the move, and what liquidity was cleared or created as a result.

Once you understand that price follows liquidity - not narratives, not indicators, not opinions - charts stop looking as chaotic.

They start looking intentional.

And once you see that, you’re no longer trading the story.

You’re trading the structure.
